# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# React Code Challenge 
<p>This project contains 3 main pages 
<ul>
  <li>homepage</li>
  <li>movies page(include movies and series tab select)</li>
  <li>movie detail page</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h2>What we are doing here?</h2> 
<p>In this project the main focus is on getting data from API and listing them on the display.</p>
<p>First you can search your movie name in the search input on homepage and then using <i><strong>Fetch<strong></i> all the data belongs to movie will appear on display.
<br>
from now on user can select any movie element on the list and see the movie details page.
</p>

<h2>Tools:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>React Router Dom: for transition between components and pages without refreshing the browser</li>
  <li>Use Reducer: state management across APP</li>
  <li>Context API: for better usage of useReducer in all components</li>
  <li>Fetch: for requesting data from Rest API</li>
</ul>
